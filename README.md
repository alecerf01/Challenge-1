# Challenge 1 Web Dev Bootcamp

## Making existing HTML and CSS code more accessible
 
As part of a weekly challenge, I have been set to make a set of starter code more accessible so that the site is optomised for search engines. Starting by downloading and pulling the starter code onto my computer and altering it so the functionality of the page doesn't change, but the doe itself is consolidated and any redundancies are removed.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.
